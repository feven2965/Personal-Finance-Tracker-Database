--Here's an example of how you could create views for a personal finance tracker database:
--Let's say we want to create two views:
--TotalExpensesPerCategory: This view will display the total expenses for each expense category.
--MonthlyIncomeSummary: This view will summarize monthly income.



-- View: TotalExpensesPerCategory
CREATE VIEW TotalExpensesPerCategory AS
SELECT c.category_name, SUM(t.amount) AS total_expenses
FROM Transactions t
JOIN Categories c ON t.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.category_type = 'expense'
GROUP BY c.category_name;

-- View: MonthlyIncomeSummary
CREATE VIEW MonthlyIncomeSummary AS
SELECT MONTH(t.date) AS month, YEAR(t.date) AS year, SUM(t.amount) AS total_income
FROM Transactions t
JOIN Categories c ON t.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.category_type = 'income'
GROUP BY MONTH(t.date), YEAR(t.date);

--With these views, you can easily retrieve summarized information about expenses per category and monthly 
--income without having to write complex SQL queries every time. You can simply query these views to get the desired information.
